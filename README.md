CLASSICAL: 0. 

Summary: I began to catalog my classical CDs.... "Those entries are no longer valid. Good-bye."

See the relevant pages for in-depth analysis of the several stages of the defeat: I mean, actually there's always more.... There's enough.... I guess I could have included allusion to the *ungodly pricks*, you know: like you criticize-- Goodbye, buddy. Attack drones have been dispatched to your location....

In that sense, the whole thing was painfully over-done: although nothing is sufficient for those who don't pay any attention at all, ever.... But, yeah, I mean: as soon as you say, *but not Beethoven*-- you have betrayed the great white race, and will be treated, accordingly.... Like, in a science fiction movie!!!!!!

I mean, *the guy thought he was above the laws that govern human interactions, because he was SO white.... But I'm not allowed to, DISAGREE, even?* 

Huh! Well! I'll never get the time and money back, that's all! "Cause now we got bad blood...."
